\*.blend files contain original models, which have miroring of geometry and separate
 parts, both of which make updating the models much easier.
 
\*_merge.blend files will containe versions of the models where all the geometry has been
 placed in a single object so that the model will form a single object when placed in the
 game. Mirror modifier (and others) will also be applied to the mesh in these models. This
 makes them harder to edit but useful for exporting. I will be keeping these files in the
 repository if there are no significant objections.
 
\*.blend[1-2] files are automatic blender backups which will be added to .gitignore.
